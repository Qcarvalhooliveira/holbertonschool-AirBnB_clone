# **AirBnB clone - Web static** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* A static website refers to a website that consists of fixed files stored on a web server. These files typically include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static content. The term "static" implies that the content remains the same for all visitors of the website.

* Static websites are generally simpler to develop and host since they don't require complex server-side processing or database integration. They are suitable for websites with content that doesn't need frequent updates or interactivity. Examples of static websites include informational sites, portfolios, blogs, and landing pages.
